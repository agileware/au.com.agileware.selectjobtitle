# Change Job Title to Select List

Changes the Contact, Job Title field to a select list of options, removing the free-text field.
This will restrict which options users can select from and does not change stored values already in this field.

_Note_: When the user edits a contact, any saved values that are _not_ in the Job Title option group will _not_ be shown in the select list.
